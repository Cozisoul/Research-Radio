It's a process of purificationâ€”finding the single, clear voice within the cosmic static. The parallels to archival work are impossible to ignore.",

    "summary": "Revisiting the principles of Konstantin Grcic's 'Office for Design'. The idea of a practice as an 'office' rather than a 'studio' resonates deeply. It implies a systematic, professional, and tool-agnostic approach to creative problems. Structure is not a constraint; it is the ultimate enabler of freedom.",
